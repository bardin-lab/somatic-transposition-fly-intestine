## Contains scripts and sources for various Drosophila Melanogaster genome datasets.

So far this only contains modencode data, but the idea is that we will keep this updated with more data.

To download and convert the modencode data, type
``` bash
make modencode
```

The scripts require click, pysam, pybedtools and wget.
